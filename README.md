# GetLine Clone

This is a clone of the C standard libary's "getline" function written from scratch based on the description in the man page. This project may also be know as the 42 project "Get Next Line". 

The simplest way to describe what it does is it takes a file with text, and displays to the terminal one line at a time. It does this by parsing for line break characters like '/n' and then storing each line in a char array which is then outputted.
